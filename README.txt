FinancialReport_V1.0_TPL
================

This one is a module for your pilots to directly search for their routes from your website rather than going to the actual website. 
Don't worry I checked that website and it's free to use.

Install:

1. Unzip the folder anywhere you want.
2. Upload in the order of folders.
3. To access the module for individual pilot use this: <?php echo url('/pfinance') ;?>.
4. To access the module for All pilots use this: <?php echo url('/pfinance/pilots') ;?>.
5. Enjoy.
